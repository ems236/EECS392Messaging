# EECS 392 - Final Project

## Localized Classroom Messaging
### Frameworks/Structures Used
1. Multipeer connectivity
2. Image/PDF display
3. Others?

### Student App (Client app)
This application is for students. They can connect to a teacher's host and take part in a multitude of interactions with the classroom.
1. Discussion Board: Group chat for all students and the professor
2. Directed Questions: Ask a question directly to the professor (no students see). Questions can also tag specific slides/visuals for reference.
3. Live Slides: Student can see the slides or other visuals the teacher chooses to add to the class lecture. These slides can be in live mode which causes the slides to continue with the teacher, so as they switch between slides, the student will as well. The student also has the option of turning this off so they can continue to review slides they need more time on. The student can also add a question with the slide pre-referenced on the directed questions page.
4. In-Class Quizzes: When a teacher submits a quiz. All students will get a popup for the quiz questions. Once all students submit their response (or the teacher completes the quiz), the teacher can see the results of the quiz.

### Teacher App (Host app)
This application is for the teachers who want to host this environment in their classrooms. They can setup a classroom (set of sessions), display and run through slides/other visuals, view student questions, and create quizzes and see the statistics of the results. 
-- If there is time. Give the teacher the ability to display the statistics of the quiz in a more visually appealing fashion --
